This plugin aids the map development process by offering easy ways to edit map settings, features, and add new features onto your maps by offering a realtime tag editor 
for all button tags and objects like wallruns, walljumps, boosts, etc. Along with all data assosiated with said object. This plugin also offers the abillity to easily 
edit the settings of your maps, and in the future will offer ways to visualize parts of different tags in your maps, and much more.

If you have created a map kit or map addon which you want added to the plugin, (idk how we will handle these if theres a way through github) or DM @grif-0 and submissions 
will be quality assured and handled from there.
